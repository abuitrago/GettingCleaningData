# GettingCleaningData
Repository for getting and cleaning data course project


## Please take into account:
* The script requires the libraries: library(plyr); library(dplyr) in that order.
* Set as working directory the directory external to "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.

### The scrip follows the instructions of the course project:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##### The output is the file “mean_activity_subject.txt” containing the data set.
